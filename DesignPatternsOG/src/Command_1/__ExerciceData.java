/*    Let’s assume we have a Car class:

    public class Car {

        public void forward(){
            System.out.println("Car goes forward");
        }
        public void backward() {
            System.out.println("Car goes backward");
        }
        public void left(){
            System.out.println("Car goes left");
        }
        public void right(){
            System.out.println("Car goes right");
        }

    }

    Using the command pattern, you must design and implement an action game for a mobile phone:
            • It is a game where you need to control a car yourself with the number keyboard of the phone;
            • Number 1 to 4 of the keyboard are the actions for the game: forward, backward, left, right;
            • We want to be able to undo the last action that we have performed;
            • We want a flexible design, where we can change the keys for the actions if the user wants it.

    You can use the main below, which is only partially implemented:

    public class MobilePhone {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Game game = new Game();
            // TODO SETUP
            game.pushKey(2);
            game.pushKey(2);
            game.pushKey(3);
            game.pushKey(2);
            game.pushKey(0);
            game.pushKey(1);
            game.undo();
        }
    }*/

}
