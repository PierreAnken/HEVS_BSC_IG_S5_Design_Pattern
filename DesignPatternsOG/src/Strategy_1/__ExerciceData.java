/*
    A class wants to decide at run-time which algorithm it should use to sort
    an array of int (e.g. { 99, 11, 2, 33, 12, 1, 0, 99, 34, 35 }). Many
    different sort algorithms are already available.

    You receive a starting code that implements three sorting algorithms,
    which uses a bad-programming style (switch).

    Design and refactor a solution that encapsulates different sort algorithms
    (for instance bubbleSort, quickSort, etc.) using the Strategy pattern.
