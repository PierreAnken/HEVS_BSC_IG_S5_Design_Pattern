/*      Imagine you are an architect of houses “clefs-en-main” (with on the road prices).
        You build only one unique kind of house, with always the same plan. More concretely,
        you build a quadratic house with four walls.

        The walls can be made of different materials: wood, bricks or glass. This depends
        if a customer prefers Swiss wood chalet, a typical Dutch house (only bricks),
        or a very modern German glass office house.

        Your application should build several of those houses and give their total price.

        Think how you could design such an application with the factory method pattern.
        For that, define clearly:
            - the creator
            - the concrete creator
            - the product
            - the concrete product

    Then, implement your design.

    What happens if a new customer wants a house with simple plaster (plâtre) walls?
    What do you need to change in your implementation? Is the factory method pattern helpful? Why?*/
