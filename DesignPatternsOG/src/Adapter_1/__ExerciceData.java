    /*      Stacks and queues are examples of containers with special insertion
            and removal behaviors and a special access behavior.

            Stacks: Insertion and removal in a stack must be carried out in such a way
            that the last data inserted is the first one to be removed. One can only
            retrieve and remove a data element from a stack by way of special access
            point called the "top". Traditionally, the insertion and removal methods
            for a stack are called push and pop, respectively. push inserts a data
            element at the top of the stack. pop removes and returns the data element
            at the top of the stack. A stack is used to model systems that exhibit LIFO
            (Last In First Out) insert/removal behavior.

            Queues: Data insertion and removal in a queue must be carried out in such a
            way that the first one to be inserted is the first one to be removed. One can
            only retrieve and remove a data element from a queue by way of special access
            point called the "front". Traditionally, the insertion and removal methods
            for a queue are called enqueue and dequeue, respectively. enqueue inserts a
            data element at the "end" of the queue. dequeue removes and returns the data
            element at the front of the queue. A queue is used to model systems that
            exhibit FIFO (First In First Out) insertion/removal behavior.

            Stacks and queues can be easily implemented by adapting with a list.
            Using the adapter pattern, design and implement those classes.
            Our starting interfaces are the following:

            public interface MyQueue<E> {
                public void enQueue(E element);
                public E deQueue();
            }

            public interface MyStack<E> {
                public void push(E element);
                public E pop();
            }*/

}
