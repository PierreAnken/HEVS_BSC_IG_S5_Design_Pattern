/*    Modern touristic online shops should allow a tourist to book a package of services, such as:
            - hotel room or flat
            - ski pass (maybe different types)
            - wellness service - etc.
    Every service has a price and a description, and can be booked several times inside the same package.
    Using the decorator pattern, design and implement a simulated shop that allows to buy such a package.*/
