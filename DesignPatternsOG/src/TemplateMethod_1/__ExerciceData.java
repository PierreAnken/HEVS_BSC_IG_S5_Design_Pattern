/*      You need to implement an application to prepare a dinner in a restaurant.
        The process always follows the same steps:
            - serve water
            - prepare vegetables
            - prepare main menu
            - prepare cheese
            - prepare dessert
            - prepare coffee
            - clean table

        Serving the water and cleaning the table are always the same.

        However, the other steps are different for each restaurant.

        Implement this application using the template method pattern.*/
