/*      Our usual car manufacturer has decided to use the command pattern in order to control
        all onboard instruments of his new type of car:
            - speed control
            - breaks
            - clutch (embrayage in French)
            - Right indicator
            - Left indicator
            - short lights
            - long lights
        As in planes, the manufacturer also would like to add a sort of black box inside his car.
        The goal is to store all actions that happened within the car.

        Design and implement a controller of all those instruments. For that, use the command pattern.*/
