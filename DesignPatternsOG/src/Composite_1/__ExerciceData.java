    /*      You have to write a game application.
            You must control a team of players (maybe 11, maybe 6, maybe 5).

            A player can

                • Enter the field
                • Shoot
                • Cry
                • Simulate an injury

            In this game, you can control either one or a group of players,
            or a group of groups of players, calling on them their methods.

            Design in UML an application for those requirements that use one
            design pattern, and implement it in Java.*/
