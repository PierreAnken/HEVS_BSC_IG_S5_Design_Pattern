/*      Cars have all on-board applications for controlling and helping the driver.
        Letâ€™s design an on-board system class that controls three sensors
        (temperature, road condition, speed) and sends warnings to the driver when necessary.

        You can understand that it is very important that only one unique instance of this
        class is used on the car. Design and implement such a class with the Singleton pattern.

        Implement it in three ways:

            1. with a synchronized method
            2. with eagerly created instance
            3. with a double checked locking

        Design and write an application with the singleton pattern.
        Try to use a class hierarchy for the patterns.
        What is especially difficult in this hierarchy?*/
