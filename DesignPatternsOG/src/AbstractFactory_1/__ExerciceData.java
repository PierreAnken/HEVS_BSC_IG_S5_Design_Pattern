/*      a.  The goal of this exercize is that you understand well the differences between
            the factory method and the abstract factory patterns.

            For this, read the discussion in the book (p. 158 to 161) which compares the two.
            Take your time in understanding those differences.

        b.  In this exercize, you should redesign and implement the house application of
            Lab4 with the abstract factory.

            You should also be able to add Windows (Window that goes to the floor and a window
            with a structure) and Doors (large and thin doors).*/
